# Ai and Machine learning

 My Ai program will detect police cars from normal cars the purpose is so
 drivers on the road could be advised to slow down.


When there's input of an image it detects whether i could be a police car or normal car and
outputs the result with a confidence score.

## The Algorithm

Using teachable mahcine My program has a trained model on what a police car should look like including undercover cars, and what normal could would look like.
and it take the input image and outputs the confidence rate of whether its a normal car or police car.

## Running this project

1. First you need teachable machine trained model as a tensorflow keras
2. then you would want to have a image from your pictures
3. input that into the image.open
4. make sure the classes are correctly stated in order of the trained model
